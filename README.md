### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**rmcgranaghan/rmcgranaghan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building knowledge graphs, knowledge networks, and [knowledge commons](https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/pub/space-knowledge-commons) to answer space science questions
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about facilitating large, diverse teams to be greater than the sum of their parts and to learn together in the *liminal* spaces
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on connecting science questions to open science practices ([Helio-KNOW](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/blob/main/README.md) is a good project for this)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with tools and realization of knowledge graph ideas
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about *[Flourishing Salons](https://twitter.com/FlourishSalons)*
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a competitive gymnast for the first 20 years of my life
